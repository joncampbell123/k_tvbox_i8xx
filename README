Kernel-level component for Tv Box v3.0 Intel 855/915/965 graphics chipsets.
Working with anything beyond basic framebuffer manipulation requires that we
have a contiguous region of physical memory to make the "page table". on top
of that, the region of memory has to be uncacheable---reads and writes we
perform must take effect immediately, the normal deep caching doing for most
apps is unacceptable. Since userspace can't do this, we need this kernel-level
part to do it, so the user-space part can worry about the rest.

Device node:   /dev/tvbox_i8xx (char device)
Purpose:       To handle gory kernel-level details involving the Intel graphics
               Page Tables, locating them, safely restoring them, and maintaing
               a local copy in system memory that userspace can modify. If
               mmap() is used, the driver forces the kernel to make the page
               non-cacheable to ensure that userspace's updates go through
               immediately---bad things happen when stale data is used in
               Intel's style of paging.
